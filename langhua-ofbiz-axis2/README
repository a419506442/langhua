User Guide for OFBiz-Axis2 Component
====================================


Purpose:
This OFBiz-Axis2 component is to make OFBiz be an Axis2 server.


Installation:
1. Run maven clean and install and a zip file will be created under target folder.
2. Unzip the zip file.
3. Copy the framework folder to your OFBiz.
4. Copy the hot-deploy or specialpurpose folder to your OFBiz.
5. If it's specialpurpose folder, you have to add axis2 component in specialpurpose/component-load.xml manually:
   <load-component component-location="axis2"/>


Hot-deploy or specialpurpose
In pom.xml, you can change ofbizDeploy property from hot-deploy (by default) to specialpurpose, run maven clean and install to generate the zip file, unzip the file and you'll see there's a specialpurpose folder.


Axis2 client jars
By OOTB, OFBiz is a web service client, and some earlier version Axis2 jars are deployed under /framework/service/lib/. To make this component work, the jars have to be replaced with new ones.
